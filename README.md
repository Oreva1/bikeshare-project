### **Explore US Bikeshare Data**

### **Description**

In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

**What Software Do I Need?**

I used the following software to complete this project:

•	Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda

•	A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.

•	A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).


### **Files Used**

These three city dataset files were used for this project:

•	chicago.csv

•	new_york_city.csv

•	washington.csv
